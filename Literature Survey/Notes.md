## File System Support Solution

+ The main focus of this paper was on creating a system that maintains the integrity of files hosted on the cloud by untrusted servers.
+ Looking deeper into their implementation-:
	+ A B+ tree that serves as a Merkle Tree is constructed to keep track of files while maintaining a low tree depth.
	+ The verification of files uploaded happens by means of a 32 bit hash.
+ They also managed to integrate their implementation with dropbox.
